# MygithubSample
This app uses github api to get info about the repositories.<br />
This application is made using MVVM Architecture.<br />
It uses the github token as an Authentication header in order to parse 
the json data using retrofit.<br />
The Activities are <br />
Credactivty.<br />
MainActivity.<br />
I took the login token in Credactivity and used it to get data.<br />
The repository data is displayed on the MainActivity.<br />
I used SharedPreferences to store the login credentials until you logout.<br />
This needs much updated and can easily be achieved,but kept aside due to lack of time<br />
as i was preoccupied with my personel work<br />
Thank you.<br />
